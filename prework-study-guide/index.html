        <ul>
          <li>HTML means Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE is a declaration that informs the browser that the file type is HTML. This is not case sensitive, but HTML elements are case sensitive.</li>
          <li>HTML files usually have an opening and closing tag represented with angle brackets.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag.</li> 
          <li>Examples include; text elements, header elements, image elements, list elements</li>
          <li>A tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Head elements contain metadata that enables the browser to render the page correctly.</li>
          <li>Elements inluded with the head element are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS means Cascading Style Sheet</li>
          <li>Three ways of creating CSS files; Inline, Internal and External CSS.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS applies to specific HTML tag only.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS applies to the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External CSS allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, this makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>When using style sheet, we link the file using a (link) element palced in the HTML's (head).</li>
          <li>CSS Rule: Declaration Block holds declarations which nests the property and their value.</li>
          <li>Margin indicates how much space around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>Padding indicates how much space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together to help us write "DRY" code.</li>
        </ul>
